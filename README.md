# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm always looking to build my skills and learn coding. By working on various projects using languages and technologies I'm unfamiliar with, I solidify my foundations in coding and create tangible results as proof of my learning.

For this project, I created a book tracker web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This application allows users to manage their reading habits by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing books in a reading list. The application leverages MongoDB for cloud data storage and implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The primary motivation behind this software was to prove I can implement cloud databases and to dive deeper into the MERN stack, a technology stack I've been interested in for a while. It also served as a test of my coding foundations, allowing me to explore various language features and libraries while solving a real-world problem: simplifying book tracking.

# Cloud Database

I used MongoDB Atlas as the cloud database for this project. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that handles all the complexities of deploying, managing, and healing deployments in the cloud.

The database structure consists of collections for storing book data. Each book document includes fields such as title, author, description, and even date published. This schema allows for efficient management and retrieval of book records.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code (VSC) as my code editor along with various extensions to enhance the development experience. The complete setup allowed for efficient coding, error-checking, and project management. I also had extensive help from ChatGPT and the Internet.

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based)

### Tools and Technologies

- **Visual Studio Code**: The primary code editor used for this project, enhanced with extensions for JavaScript and React development.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB, used to manage data and interact with the database.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database service used to store book data.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client used to make requests to the backend API.

# Future Work

- Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own reading lists
- Enhance the user interface with better styling and usability improvements.
- Add filtering and sorting options for the book list.
- Integrate additional features such as book ratings and reviews.
